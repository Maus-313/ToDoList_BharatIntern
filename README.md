# ToDoList App

Introducing our new ToDoList app, a result of dedicated work during my internship at Bharat Intern. This app, built with the robust and modern Kotlin language, is designed to help you manage your tasks efficiently and effectively.

## Key Features

- **Task Creation**: Easily add new tasks to your list. Each task can be customized with details to help you stay organized.
- **Task Modification**: Update your tasks as your plans change. Our app makes it simple to edit task details at any time.
- **Task Checking**: Mark tasks as completed with a simple check/uncheck feature. This allows you to keep track of your progress and stay focused on your goals.
- **Task Deletion**: Remove tasks that are no longer needed. Our app keeps your list clean and manageable.
- **Undo Delete**: Accidentally deleted a task? No problem! Our app includes an undo delete feature, so you can recover tasks quickly.

Our ToDoList app is more than just a task manager - it's a productivity tool designed to make your life easier. Try it out today and experience the difference!
